 Hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the Macroverse. Today we're going to talk about the most recent FOMC. I don't know of course talk about the crypto markets as well and some of the longer term trends there. If you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel and get the video thumbs up and check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium. I didn't do the cryptoverse.com. How basically said a lot of the same things he always says today. But just so you know in case you're curious they did the Fed decided to keep rates at 4.5% and furthermore they will continue reducing their holdings of treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage back securities. So quantitative tightening continues. Again, you know it has slowed down considerably compared to what it once was. That just basically gives them more runway and you can see the slope of the balance sheet of the Fed. And you can see once upon a time it had they kept it on the rate that they were on say like mid 24 then by now it would already be at around 6.1 trillion. But instead it's at 6.6.7 trillion. That they slowed it in 2024 as well. And then of course we know they ended up slowing it down again and you can see how once again it's no longer sort of on that same path. But you could argue that by the fact that they've decreased the runoff it's allowed QT to ultimately continue longer than in other words would have. Because let's just say the number that would be concerning. I don't know where it is, right? I mean it could be way lower than where we are right now. But let's just say it's 6.6 trillion. We would already hit it by now more or less how they continued on that path. But because they've slowed it down it's obviously we still have a long way to go to actually get to that level. So quantitative tightening continues interest rates from in the same. That was always the base case, right? And I also said that that part's not even that relevant because it was the base case. And what's kind of more interesting for markets is you know what sort of the guidance going forward. And again as I've said before it's more so when we talk about the markets for talking about which assets are likely going to perform better than others. So when you have lower interest rates and no quantitative tightening then you normally see altcoins start out performing or higher risk assets outperforming. When you have higher interest rates and quantitative tightening that's when lower risk assets start to outperform with any chastect class. That's why you're seeing and for the last few years that's why you've seen Bitcoin do so much better. Overlay or if you just simply look, you know, if you look at the Bitcoin chart it's been fine. But if you were to look at say the all coin market, right? Like others divided by Bitcoin. So looking at the market cap of others which is basically everything outside of the top 10 up to maybe like 125 or something much or how high they go. You can see that's actually been bleeding. Other have been bleeding to Bitcoin while quantitative tightening and higher interest rates have been going on. But again, it's nothing we haven't seen before. We've seen the same things in prior cycles. So the other thing that I thought was kind of interesting was that there's been obviously a lot of discussion by a lot of people about whether the Fed would cut here in July and going into a meeting it made absolutely no sense to assume that the Fed would cut even though there was obviously a lot of political pressure from the to do so. But you can see as we said before, right? The Fed did not cut rates. And if you look at sort of expectations, we still have sort of July on here because it hasn't they haven't sort of updated this yet. But in September, what's interesting is now it's more it's actually shifted away from a rate cut right now. The markets are actually pricing in more likely that they're going to hold rates steady in September. Now again, mid September is still about six weeks away. So a lot could happen between now and then. But that was one of the things that I think investors were, you know, someone interested by because you have president Trump on one hand saying that they will cut in September, or that's what he heard. But then you hear Powell say they've made no decision about what they're going to do in September. And so it's kind of interesting when you think about it like that. And what's really interesting is when you look at like all Bitcoin pairs and just kind of think about 2017, 2016, 2017, and I've said this before, you don't even necessarily need to know what the Fed is doing to have an idea of where these charts might go. Look at 2017. I mean, you can see that there was this balance by all Bitcoin pairs in the summer, but ultimately they came back down and, you know, and they started to really come back down in September. And so it kind of raises the question, well, like, what if they don't cut rates in September? And what if, you know, what if the, the, the, Bitcoin rally that we've had since June would spew it on expectations of rate cuts, but what if those rate cuts don't actually manifest, or maybe they do, but you don't get as many as people think, right? Maybe instead of getting two or three, you just get one rate cut or something. Um, again, it's always easy to assign a narrative after the fact. My base case is that we will see all Bitcoin pairs roll over, you know, sort of in that September, October timeframe. You could obviously, you know, content that it's already happening, but there's still above the 20 week SMA. So there's no guarantee they won't hold here for a while before dropping back down. Right. I mean, they could hold above the Bullmark's Barpan for a little bit. Maybe even get another balance. I mean, you can see what happened over here when it came back to the 20 week SMA. There was little bounce. So don't dismiss that idea. But the point is, is that there's likely going to be a narrative to accompany the devaluation of all coins against Bitcoin. Again, that'll probably take place sometime, like September, October. And maybe that narrative that people will assign is perhaps, you know, the expectation of rate cuts is an actually met. And maybe you get rate cuts, but you don't get as many. Again, I don't know the exact reasoning, but that's at least something to to consider. Again, Bitcoin, when when you see off Bitcoin pairs go down, Bitcoin's sucking that liquidity, right? Just like Ethereum has been sucking liquidity out of the awkward market as well. Right. I mean, again, all sorts are down against e about 45% since e went home back in April. So not only is Bitcoin potentially going to take liquidity from all coins, but Ethereum already is. Right. Ethereum already is taking that liquidity from the awkward coins. And so you also see yield tire. I've been very adamant that I think the 10 year yield is likely heading back up here to 5%. I also think, you know, you're probably going to see the dollar, you know, has had a nice little rally here, back up to its bullmark sport ban. As I've said before, with a dollar, what I think the most likely outcome is, I think that it's going to spend the next several months kind of building out a base and then probably go up in in 2026. Again, you can kind of look at maybe a long term trend line for the dollar. And then see that that's kind of why I would expect it. It doesn't mean it can't come back down, right? It certainly could. And if it does, then I still would expect to sort of break through in in 2026. But again, I mean, Bitcoin is still trading right around where it has been. Ethereum still doing just fine. Again, my base case for Ethereum is that I think it will break through 4k within the next few months. There's always a scenario where if it can't break through 4k on the first attempt, it might check in with a bullmark sport ban before going through. But I wouldn't necessarily count on that happening. I also could see it going up to 4800 and then maybe getting a pullback to 4k as well. But I'm still in the camp that, especially with the Fed, continuing down this path of kind of being more hawkish and not leaning in to rate cuts. What if you just see Bitcoin dominance and Ethereum dominance go up together? You can see that this metric went up here in 2020. And so what happens if that happens? I mean, I think it's certainly a possibility that you see that play out where you just see Bitcoin dominance and Ethereum dominance go up together and people just sort of crowd into the blue chips. And then the narrative starts to hit really strong that we'll what if all these altcoins just keep on leaning back to Bitcoin and keep on bleeding back to Ethereum. Again, do these narratives have to put out tomorrow? No, but we've sort of laid out the reasoning for how these markets could play out and the narratives that ultimately could be assigned to them. If you go back over to the Fed, I was our press release. They say the uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated. One of the things that Powell was saying today was that basically that tariffs should only cause sort of a one time pricing crease. But that the Fed will use its tools to make sure that's the case. So I feel like what Powell's trying to say is that he's not going to cave to political pressures. No matter what, right? If you were, he would have cut today. But he didn't. There were some members of the committee who dissented. You can see that down here. And while they both dissented, they thought that we should have cut rates by 25 basis points. But the majority of the members did not think that. And I think the reasoning, as they've said, I think they're just worried that you might get this price increase caused by the tariffs, whether the right or not. That's the reasoning for it. And so that's, you know, that's ultimately why I don't really think they will. Or they should have been cutting rates at this meeting because of that uncertainty that's still in the air as to us to how inflation might sort of rear back. The other thing too that I think makes it difficult for the Fed is the fact that there continues to be these like pauses on tariffs. It's almost like they just implemented the tariffs. Then we could go ahead and get it over with, right? Like whatever the price increase is going to be, we could get it over with. But when you keep delaying and delaying and delaying the implementation of certain tariffs, it just means that the price increase that's going to be associated with that keeps getting pushed out into the future. So therefore this tailwind for inflation keeps getting pushed out further in the future. And if you have something like that happen, it makes sense that the Fed would be a little worried not to cut rates. I think that without tariffs, I think there's a decent chance that the Fed would have already started cutting rates. But, you know, and the tariffs are certainly interesting to look out with the markets. I mean, I think today there is an announcement on for a copper tariffs, right? A big announcement of that copper and you can actually see that copper drops like 20%. Now, I mean, it might seem somewhat unintuitive, right? Like if you're raising the price, why would the price, if you're raising the price on tariffs for that, why would it drop? Again, it could be that people might just elect to not buy it if it's too high, right? If it's too high, sometimes people don't buy it. And imagine you're at a restaurant and you own a restaurant and you're selling, well, let's say you're just selling a sandwich for $10. And you want to increase your revenue so you raise the cost of the sandwich to $12. Okay, a lot of consumers are probably going to be okay with that. They might complain about it some, right? They might complain about not getting double-check or anything. But that doesn't mean they're going to change their habits. If you change it to $14, then you probably will have some people decide not to pay. But it might not be enough to lower revenue, right? The increase, raising it from then 12 to 14, you still might have more revenue even if you have fewer total sales because the price per sale might go up. But then let's say you get even greenier. And now you're like, you know what, let's just raise prices to $20. You might assume that your revenue would go up because the last two times you increase prices, revenue did go up. But at some point that supply and demand goes the other way, right? And then you realize that maybe the demand isn't as high as you thought and perhaps people aren't willing to actually pay that price because they can just go somewhere else. What a price isn't as high or maybe they'll just eat at home. So again, like, yeah, technically speaking, if you raise prices on things, you would expect inflation to go up. But eventually that can also go the other way, right? If prices get raised too much, then people might just elect not to buy it or they might buy it, you know, they might wait to buy it, right? Or maybe they decided, maybe they saw this coming and they decided to front run all their purchases. And now they don't need to buy anything because they decided to front run the tariffs of again, well, so a lot of things to think about with that. But again, you don't get 20% drops and copper every single day and you can see it's down about 20%. So that's a relatively big move by copper. I mean, the last time it dropped, like, I mean, the last time I hit this was like a 13, 14% drop, that was back in late March. Obviously, the markets were in turmoil then. And they're doing much better now. But it just goes to show you how quickly, how quickly things like commodities can move. And you get these these sort of these macro announcements. Beyond what I've already said, like the other things that Paul Bees said, he said he said the economies in good shape. And the next step, say, take, take, or likely in the direction of cutting rates. He says that we have a really good labor marker right now. And again, a lot of this is to say, well, if you have a good labor market, if real GDP for the last quarter was 3% which it was, and we just got that today, if all that's true, then why do you need to cut rates? The assets that are good are going to likely, you know, they'll continue to do well as long as the economy's doing well. And the people that are loaded up on much higher risk assets, they're going to complain because they would probably prefer lower rates. And QE so that the markets so that their bags can be pumped, right? So they can offload to the next fool. But the reality is this entire cycle is played out like this. The better assets continue to do well. The worst assets continue to do poorly. And the people that, you know, are in the best assets, some of them will think that those assets are going to stop doing well. And therefore, they trade them for other assets that are doing poorly, thinking those assets will catch up. And then those assets just never catch up with technical analysis, a lot of this hand way to write it won't believe in most technical analysis to be completely honest. But one of the things that I think does makes sense to believe in is momentum. And as I've said before, assets that are going higher are more likely to go higher than assets that are not. So when you, when you're looking at like the crypto markets and you're looking at something like Bitcoin, there might be a lot of people say, well, Bitcoin already went out such as much amount. Therefore, it's less likely to keep going up. Let me trade it for something else. And then one of the things I'm happening is then Bitcoin continues to perform the asset that they trade it for. Because there was a reason why Bitcoin was outperforming that all coin. So before hand, and that reason actually hasn't even changed since she made the conversion. And so that's kind of how a lot of times this plays out as people trade their winners for the losers and then realize they should have just stuck with the winners. So, as far as Bitcoin dominance goes, as I've said before, I mean, right now it's trying to find support out around 60%. I think you're going to have another rally by dominance. It does not have to go to a new high. And I still think you will have a rally. The reason it might not go to a new high is if it depends on the strength of the e-th Bitcoin. But there's still a good chance that all Bitcoin pairs will struggle, especially like I would say a little bit later in the month, maybe you'd ought to month from now or so. I could see it, you know, I could see it, you know, sort of bouncing around here for a bit and then going down. It might even go all the way back up here. I mean, it's not impossible. But ultimately, I do expect it to sell off again as liquidity goes back to Bitcoin. But again, if it's going to play out like 2017 cycle, that process might not actually occur till that three to four weeks from now. So that's generally what I wanted to say today about the FOMC. Not a whole lot of changes. The only, the only real major change. Let me reload this again. The only real major change is just the markets are now saying there's a higher chance that they won't cut rates at the September meeting. Again, these probabilities can change very quickly to just keep it on that.
